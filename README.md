# Data-Science-Capstone-4th-Week
Fourth week exercise on Data Science Capstone  
## Introduction to Business Problem  

In this hypothetical exercise I will work for a retail company trying to position a new store format of small convenience stores in mid size and large colombian cities.

In the first part of this excercise, it is required to compare mid size and large cities in Colombia  - South America with cities with similar population in Europe and North America trying to establish if they are more like americans or europeans.  It may help this hypothetical retail convenience store chain to determine if their stores format should follow European or American model.

In the second part of the study I will try to test a procedure to select places to open new stores, and determine criteria that consider low coverage, low crime rate, and large population.  

A priory, the stewardship committee think that good location for new stores are those places with lack of coverage (small number of other convenience stores), high population, and low crime rate.

My (hypothetical) sponsor is also interested in clustering neighbourhoods based on the recent census information to see if they can identify neighbourhood particularities that can be considered to personalize store formats.

For this study, I will limit my effort to Medellín, but the objective is establish a repeatable procedure that can be then used to analyze other cities such as Bogotá, Cali, Barranquilla.
